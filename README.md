# General behaviour

The autosplitter supports in-game timing.
- When loading the autosplitter, if your timing method is set to Real Time (RTA), LiveSplit will pop up a message prompt asking you if you want to switch over to Game Time
- Game time is full IGT in arcade mode. In normal story mode, Game Time will be Time without Loads. In order to make the autosplitter correctly manage the timing method, make sure to let it manage the start of your run

Automatic splitting can be set in the options.
